# River-Crossing-Puzzle
River Crossing IQ Logic Puzzles require you to get all of the characters(crossers) across a river
in a small boat. The boat can cross the river many times to get anyone across. In our game
each character(crosser) has some properties, the most important are:
● Weight : This property represents the weight of a crosser.
● Eating Rank : This property represents the eating rank of a crosser. Crossers with higher
eating ranks can eat crossers with lower eating ranks.
We have three major categories of crossers in our game(farmers, animals, plants). Farmers
don’t eat any crosser, can’t be eaten by any crosser and can raft the boat. Animals and plants
cannot raft the boat. There are two major types of animals (carnivorous and herbivorous).
Carnivorous can only eat herbivorous but can’t eat plants. Herbivorous can only eat plants.
